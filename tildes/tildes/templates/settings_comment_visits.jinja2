<p>Tildes can mark which comments were posted since your previous visit to a topic's comments (and which topics have any new ones), but doing so requires keeping track of when that previous visit happened. This has a privacy implication, so the feature is opt-in.</p>

<p>While this feature is enabled, we will record and store data about your most recent visit to each topic's comments. We store only the single most recent visit&mdash;any previous visit data for that topic is replaced if you visit the same one again later.</p>

<p>This data is retained for 30 days. After not visiting a particular topic for 30 days, the data about your last visit to it will be deleted.</p>

<p>Disabling the feature will stop marking comments but will not delete any existing data, only prevent new data from being stored. The previously-stored data will be deleted after 30 days, as usual.</p>
