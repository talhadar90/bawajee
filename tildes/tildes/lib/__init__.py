"""Contains the overall "library" for the application.

Defining constants, behavior, etc. inside modules here (as opposed to other locations
such as in models) is encouraged, since it often makes it simpler to import elsewhere
for tests, when only a specific constant value is needed, etc.

Modules here should *never* import anything from models, to avoid circular dependencies.
